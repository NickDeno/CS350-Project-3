Sky: Implemented SIG_TERM and the masking setup
Nicholas: Implemented SIG_INT functionality
Cole: Implemented SIG_STOP, SIG_CONT, and the extra credit

For the extra credit:
The initial implementaion when ran on the signal test interrupted the process that was currently executing, not the process invoked by the command.
Making it work the way ^c usually does required tracking the pid of the last process invoked and interrupting that process. This was done by creating
another syscall that is invoked in the main function of sh.c to store it. Then when a console command is ran, it calls setipid, the new syscall, 
which stores the invoked pid to be referenced when ^c is executed.
